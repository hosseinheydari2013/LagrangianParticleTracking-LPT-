# LagrangianParticleTracking-LPT-
simple Lagrangian particle tracking written in C++

Currently, it has only solidBodyRotation implemented. The numerical integration for solidBodyRotation equations is done with RK3 (Runge-Kutta third order). Visualisation of the particles is done by using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).
